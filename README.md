simpleWeather
=============

A simple command-line weather app.

#### Setup

Make a file called "private.json" and include the following data, replacing it with your information:

	{
		"api_key": "MY_API_KEY",
		"latitude": "MY_LATITUDE",
		"longitude": "MY_LONGITUDE",
		"full_location": "MY_LATITUDE, MY_LONGITUDE"
	}

You can register for an API key here: https://developer.forecast.io/register.

Once that's done, simply run the script using whatever method you prefer.
